# Third-Party Notices

BioshockRemasteredHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

Nothing in this repository is derived from, or redistributes any part of,
BioShock Remastered.

## OpenTrack

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.

## BioShock Remastered footage and screenshots

- **Files:** `assets/readme-clip.gif`
- **Rights holder:** the developers and publishers of BioShock Remastered, together with the
  rights holders of any third-party marks visible in frame.
- **Usage:** a recording of the game running with this mod, captured on a
  legitimately purchased copy, shown so a reader can see what the mod does
  before installing it.
- **Bundled:** no. The packaging scripts ship no part of `assets/`, so it is in
  neither release ZIP nor anything the launcher deploys.
- **Licence:** none is granted or implied by this repository. This material is
  not covered by the MIT licence in `LICENSE`, and nothing here permits reuse
  of it. Rights holders who would rather it were not published: open an issue
  or reach us on Discord and it comes down.

## BioShock Remastered

BioShock Remastered and all related names, logos, characters and marks are
trademarks of their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the
game this mod applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right
in them. This project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its
publishers, its engine vendor, or any other rights holder. It redistributes no
game code, no game assets and no proprietary DLLs, and it requires a
legitimately purchased copy of the game. Any engine structure offsets,
function addresses or byte patterns referenced in the source were derived by
the authors through independent analysis of a legitimately owned copy. They
are factual measurements recorded as numbers; no decompiled or disassembled
game code is stored in this repository.
